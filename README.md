1.Find Positive or Negative Number in C++

This C++ program takes a number as input from the user and determines whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

It is a simple program meant to help beginners understand:

Taking input using cin

Using conditional statements (if, else if, else) for decision making

Basic number comparisons in C++

Key Features:

Accepts an integer or floating-point number from the user

Checks:

If the number is greater than 0 → it is positive

If less than 0 → it is negative

If exactly 0 → it is zero

Displays the result clearly to the user



2.Calculate Student's Grade in C++

This C++ program calculates a student's grade based on the marks entered for different subjects. It computes the total marks, average percentage, and then assigns a grade based on the overall percentage.

Key Features:

Takes marks for multiple subjects as input (e.g., 5 subjects)

Calculates:

Total marks

Percentage

Grade (A, B, C, D, or F)

Uses conditional statements (if-else) to assign grades based on percentage

Sample Grading Criteria:

90% and above → Grade A

80%–89% → Grade B

70%–79% → Grade C

60%–69% → Grade D

Below 60% → Grade F

Educational Purpose:

This program helps beginners understand:

Input and output in C++

Arithmetic operations

Conditional logic

Handling multiple variables

It's a practical example that demonstrates how logic is applied to solve real-world tasks like result computation.



3.Find Coordinate Quadrant in C++

This C++ program takes the X and Y coordinates of a point as input and determines which quadrant the point lies in on the 2D Cartesian plane.

The plane is divided into four quadrants based on the sign of the X and Y values:

Quadrant I → X > 0 and Y > 0

Quadrant II → X < 0 and Y > 0

Quadrant III → X < 0 and Y < 0

Quadrant IV → X > 0 and Y < 0

If the point lies on the X-axis, Y-axis, or origin (0,0), the program also identifies that specifically.

Key Features:

Takes X and Y coordinates as input

Uses conditional statements to check position

Displays:

The correct quadrant

Or if the point is on an axis or at the origin

Educational Purpose:

This program is great for practicing:

Input handling

Conditional logic (if, else if)

Logical thinking based on real-world geometry

It combines math and programming concepts in a simple, easy-to-understand example for beginners.

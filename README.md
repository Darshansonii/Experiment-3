# Experiment-3


Aim  
* To develop a C++ program that performs multiple decision-based tasks using if-else statements:
  - Calculate and display a student's grade based on marks.
  - Determine the quadrant of a point using x and y coordinates.
  - Identify whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

Apparatus  
* Computer (Laptop/Desktop)  
* Keyboard and Mouse  
* Power Supply  

Software Used  
* Visual Studio Code  
* MinGW or GCC/G++ Compiler  
* Terminal or Command Prompt

Theory  
* The if-else statement is a fundamental control structure in C++ that allows a program to make decisions based on conditions.  
* It evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true; otherwise, it moves to the next condition or executes an optional else block.  
* In grading, if-else is used to categorize marks into grade ranges such as A, B, C, etc.  
* For quadrant determination, the signs of x and y coordinates are checked to decide which of the four quadrants the point lies in.  
* To determine the sign of a number, a simple comparison is done with zero using if-else conditions.  
* This program strengthens logical thinking and decision-making using basic control flow.  
* Understanding nested and chained if-else conditions is crucial for writing efficient and readable decision-based code.  
* Using if-else also prepares the learner for more advanced concepts like switch-case, loops, and complex conditionals.  
* These examples reflect real-world situations where decisions must be made based on multiple inputs or conditions.  
* The clarity and simplicity of if-else logic make it ideal for beginners to grasp the concept of conditional execution.
* If-else logic enables customized responses based on varying user input, which is essential in interactive applications.  
* It provides a step-by-step flow that is easy to trace and debug during program development.  
* The structure of if-else can be extended into nested conditions to evaluate multiple related cases efficiently.  
* Practicing with if-else conditions lays the groundwork for handling complex validations and multiple branches in large programs.

Program Features  
* Accepts marks and assigns a grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on range.  
* Accepts x and y coordinates and determines the correct quadrant or axis.  
* Accepts a number and checks whether it is positive, negative, or zero.  
* Uses clear and simple if-else statements for all decision-making tasks.  
* Displays clear output messages for each result.

Conclusion  
* The program was successfully implemented using Visual Studio Code and compiled with the GCC compiler.  
* It demonstrated effective use of if-else logic to solve real-world style problems.  
* The use of conditions helped in classifying data, making decisions, and controlling program flow.  
* This exercise strengthened foundational skills in decision-making and logical control in C++ programming.
